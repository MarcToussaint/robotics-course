=====================================
 Welcome to the Robotics Course Repo
=====================================

Github repo: https://github.com/MarcToussaint/robotics-course

This repository is used in three lectures:

* The Introduction To Robotics lecture at `U Stuttgart <https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/14-Robotics/>`_
* The Lab Course with the Real Baxter we offered for some years at `U Stuttgart <https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/teaching/practical-course-robotics-ss-19/>`_
* And now the Lab Course using simulation at both, TU Berlin and U Stuttgart

They all share the same core code, but have quite different
installation setups and exercises. Embedded below are exercises for
the lab course in simulation, and generic documentation of the
code. The code documentation refers to python interfaces -- but these
are almost identical to how users should use C++.
