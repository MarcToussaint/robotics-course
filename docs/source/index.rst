Welcome to the Robotics Course Repo
===================================

Dear Students,

this repository is used in three lectures:

* The Introduction To Robotics lecture at `U Stuttgart <https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/teaching/14-Robotics/>`_
* The Lab Course with the Real Baxter we offered for some years at `U Stuttgart <https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/teaching/practical-course-robotics-ss-19/>`_
* And now the Lab Course using simulation at both, TU Berlin and U Stuttgart

They all share the same core code, but have quite different installation setups and exercises. Please follow reading the respective sections:
