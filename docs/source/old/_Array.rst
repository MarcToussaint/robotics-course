 Array
=======

This only concerns C++. The rai code uses basic array class. This
simply inherits from std::vector<T>, but interfaces to linear algebra
libs (LAPACK and Eigen), as well as provides a concise notation (that
was meant to be closer to Matlab). The sheet below focusses on this
special notation, rather than trying to describe the full API:
