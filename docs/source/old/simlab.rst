 Lab Course in Simulation
==========================

This year we'll have to do the lab course in simulation! The goal
still is to learn about robot manipulation, integrating methods for
motion generation and perception, potentially also machine learning,
task planning, and mobile navigation.

The major time is spend on practically solving (coding) a series of
problems, with supervision by the instructors during the
session. In some lectures the instructor introduces basic
concepts. The series of exercises includes, for instance,

* generation of basic motion on the robot system,
* leveraging motion planning and optimization,
* perceiving objects and mapping them into virtual representations,
* integrating perception and motion generation for grasping, pushing and placing objects

Students are expected to work also offline, as homework, on these
problems. After going though these problems the teams spend the rest
of the course working on a final challenge.
